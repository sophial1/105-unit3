# 105-unit3

This is a repository constructed for ENGL 105 at UNC Chapel Hill. I have just started exploring using a Python Notebook with Pandas and Numpy and am a novice in data and coding.

# Datasets

I am using County Health Data from 2014-2015 and exploring the data through a lense analyizing youth mental health.
 * Download the [County Health Data](https://uncch.instructure.com/courses/4844/files/1951168/download?download_frd=1)
 * Download the [Clark County Mental Health Data Subset](http://localhost:8888/files/Desktop/project%203/CCMH_subset.csv?_xsrf=2%7C5e9e8cca%7Cb246ebc6249e9be9447d8c8c8e42b139%7C1668006870)

# Purpose and Data Use

This examination of the data is meant to find links between certain circumstances in a county and mental health issues amough the youth. Although this data does not study causation, it can express some correlation between certain data points.

# Data Exploration

In order to fully understand the data you should play around with it yourself, which you can do by following the steps in the Python Notebook. You may also be able to examine more factors that can effect mental health or data in other states and counties.

I hope you find this repository as insightful as I did.
